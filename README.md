# Docker tutorial with python 

The following examples are derived from these tutorials, courtesy of Patrick Loeber:

## Basic scripts and fastAPI_docker

Some changes were done since to work on python 3.10 and docker 26.0.0 since the tutorial is a bit out of date.

### notes:
the IMDB website can no longer be scraped via simple text screening (meaning that the original tutorial fails when running that movie picker script), so I used another of Patrick's ML tutorials as an example under the basic_scripts section. That should be more stable now.
